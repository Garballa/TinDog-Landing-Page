This landing page was one of my required projects in "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy. The main focus of this project was to create a modern looking landing page, styling it with Bootstrap. Using Bootstrap, I learned how to create a navbar, customize buttons, create a carousel, and make pricing cards. In addition, I learned about Font-Awesome and how to import icons for my webpages.
